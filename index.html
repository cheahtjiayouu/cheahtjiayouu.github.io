					<h3>Day 1, Morning</h3>
					<p> [Robert Collist] YES, IT WORKED! I&apos;ve been working on this Rift Generator for ages, and it finally opened a rift. Don&apos;t know where it leads to, but hey, who cares. *rift noises* Where... am I? Oh well, gotta find a place to stay for the night. I&apos;m gonna sign off from here for now.
</p>
					<h3>Day 1, Night</h3>
					<p> [Robert Collist] So I managed to find a hotel to stay in. The receptionist was quite rude to me earlier for some reason. I managed to draw the map of this place on a piece of paper though, note that Elysius Neo is a floating continent, and Solmaris has an underwater city below the cluster of islands. I did find a local in the reception room and he introduced the time system of this planet named Astreus to me. There are 36 hours in an Astreus day, 30 days in a month, and 88 months in a year. Also, for some reason, I feel the eerie sense of somebody watching me, so I&apos;m signing off here for now. <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1340995344074543145/1354028782062796800/unnamed_6.png?ex=67e51e92&is=67e3cd12&hm=de4b43b15fe7429e9047f5144551998568f0e31f14ccba09e90b108661ddc0c3&=&format=webp&quality=lossless" class="center">
</p>
					<h3>Day 2</h3>
					<p> [Robert Collist] Alright, day 2 in Astreus. Things are going quite swimmingly for now. I still can&apos;t shake the feeling that someone or something is watchiâ€”
						  <br>
							[???] Thats because we are.
							<br>
							[Robert Collist] Who the heck are you?
							<br>
							[Creation] I am Creation, multiplanar true god of nature, ancient growth and natural magic. I urge you to leave right now, or the others will find you.
							<br>
							[Robert Collist] And what happens if they do?
							<br>
							[Creation] Well, let&apos;s just say, those who do not escape in time get tortured to death.
							<br>
							[???] He&apos;s right. You are literally risking yourself dying by just being here.
							<br>
							[Robert Collist] Who are you now?
							<br>
							[Celestial] My name is Celestial, and I&apos;m a multiplanar true god of life and light. And it seems that the other gods are headed in your direction.
							<br>
							[Robert Collist] WAIT WHAT?! Oh no, I must get of this damned rock this instant. Why isn&apos;t the Rift Generator working when I need it the most.
							<br>
							[???] I WILL TAKE THE VEINS FROM YOUR PATHETIC, ORGANIC BODY, AND WEAR THEM LIKE A SCARF! *propels forward with wings*
							<br>
							[Robert Collist] Come on. WHY ISN&apos;T IT WORKING. *rift opening* YES, FINALLY! GOODBYE, GOD FORSAKEN ROCK!
